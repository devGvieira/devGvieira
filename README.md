### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**devGvieira/devGvieira** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data science, mostly on intelligent algorithms.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PINNs and FCNs.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am graduated on physics and I currently work with data science, but I have worked for 6+ years on teaching not only physics, but also mathematics, English, history, phylosophy, sociology, geography and even arts.
